Hi, I'm Fastattack
I'm a little python developper developing for fun.

I'm developing a game launcher called APY! Launcher, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/fastattackv/APY-Launcher), my goal is to make it a great application to organise your games and to make it customizable by anyone with an API to create extensions in python.

If you want to help me develop, have a problem with one of my project or just want to talk with me, join my discord server [here](https://discord.gg/pHPkkpXhUV).
